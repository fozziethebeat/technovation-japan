# Technovation Japan

The sample applications here demonstrate the key coding lessons provided by the
[Technovation
Challenge](https://technovationchallenge.org/curriculum-intro/registered/new/).
They've been developed by [Waffle](https://waffle-waffle.org/) to help teach
the core curriculum to girls in Japan as they participate in the Technovation
challenge.

We provide a collection of demo apps that focus on addressing one or more
United Nations [Sustainable Development Goals](https://sdgs.un.org/goals).  For
each demo app, we try to provide a version in at least two app building
frameworks.

## The Demo Apps

The primary demo app is 農業ありがとう, or Thank you Farmer in English.  This
app connects consumers of organic food with the farmers who may be unknown to
the consumer. It's meant to help inform consumers of where their food comes
from and provide a direct connection between consumer and farmer.   By using
the apps consumers can show support to farmers they otherwise would never meet
and to ultimately improve the well being and livelihood of organic farmers.

While this is the first demo app, we hope to develop more and welcome more
contributions.  The only requirement is that the app focuses on one or more
Sustainable Development Goals and demonstrates they coding curriculum points
provided by Technovation.

## The frameworks

We focus on a few well regarded frameworks:

1.  [Thunkable](https://thunkable.com/#/) One of the visual app builders
    recommended by the Technovation Challenge.  This provides fairly flexible
visual components to build sample apps.
1.  [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/) A pure javascript framework for
    building both Android and iOS apps.  We choose React Native due to its
large community, support for multiple platforms, and it being in Javascript.
